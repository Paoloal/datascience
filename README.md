This github repo consists of a couple of folders. Each folder focuses on a specific learning element in my journey to become a well rounded data scientisit.
1. Python
2. Statistics
3. Databases
4. Machine Learning
5. Feature Engineering
6. Deep Learning
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

9. Machine Learning Operations (MLOPS)

All these folders will contain projects and those projects will also be showcased on my website. In case you are interested the website is Paoloalberda.com.
As we speak (29/04/2024) this website is empty. My goal is to fill it along the way.
